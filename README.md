Fastai library provides the PET datasets and tool for training model  
Pytorch and Tensor are also used in addition to Fastai  
IPyWidget offers a GUI and interface for the model   

### Usage  
You need to download Pet_Breeds_Model.ipynb and export.pkl in order to run the code and get the prediction. 
In case you want to build model again, you also need to download Building_Model.ipynb
